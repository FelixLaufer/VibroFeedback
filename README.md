# VibroFeedback
Vibro-tactile feedback prototype hardware and software to be coupled with inertial tracking and motion analysis systems for providing real-time training feedback to patients with gait anomalies.

- ESP32 microprocessor
- accessible via WiFi and BLE
- controlling up to four vibration actuators (rotating mass motors, piezo-haptic actuators and audio-tactile exciters)
- Arduino / FreeRTOS firmware
- C++ client API
